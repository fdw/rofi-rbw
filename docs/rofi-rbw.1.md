\--typing-key-delay _MILLISECONDS_

\--selector-args _SELECTOR-ARGS_

# DEFAULT KEYBINDINGS

*enter* to use the default action

*alt+c* to copy the password

*alt+u* to copy the username

*alt+t* to copy the TOTP

*alt+m* to show a menu of the entry's components

*alt+s* to sync the contents of the vault

*alt+1* to autotype username and password, separated with a `tab` character

*alt+2* to type the username

*alt+3* to type the password

Please note that wofi does not support keybindings other than *enter*.

# CONFIGURATION

Args that start with "\--" (eg. \--version) can also be set in a config file.

Config file syntax allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c]. If an arg is specified in more than one place, then commandline values override values from the config file.

# FILES

*~/.cache/rofi-rbw.runcache*

: Saves the number pf times an entry has been used, so that they can be sorted first. Entries are hashed with sha1 so as not to leak any secrets.
