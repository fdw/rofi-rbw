# rbw-rofi
## A rofi frontend for Bitwarden

Based on the alternative [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) CLI [rbw](https://github.com/doy/rbw/) and inspired by [rofi-pass](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass), `rbw-rofi` is a simplistic password typer/copier using [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) and [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi).

## Features
- Autotype password or username (`Enter`/`Alt+3` and `Alt+2`, respectively)
- Autotype username and password (with a `tab` character in between) with `Alt+1` (and copy TOTP to clipboard)
- Copy username, password or TOTP to the clipboard (`Alt+u`, `Alt+p` and `Alt+t`, respectively)
- Show an autotype menu with all fields

## Usage
First, you need to configure `rbw`. See its documentation for that.
Then, you can start `rofi-rbw`. It is *not* available as a rofi mode.

# Configuration
You can configure `rofi-rbw` either with cli arguments or with a config file called `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rofi-rbw.rc`. In the file, use the long option names without double dashes.

## Options

| long option          | short option | possible values                                               | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

# Installation

## From distribution repositories
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rofi-rbw.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rofi-rbw/versions)

## From PyPI
`rofi-rbw` is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rofi-rbw/). You can install it with `pip install --user rofi-rbw` (or `sudo pip install rofi-rbw`).

## Manually
Download the wheel file from releases and install it with  `sudo pip install $filename` (or you can use `pip install --user $filename` to only install it for the local user).
Note that it needs `configargparse` to work.

## Dependencies
You also need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `rofi` or `wofi`
- Something to programmatically type characters into other applications. Depending on your display server, it's `xdotool`, `wtype`, `ydotool` or `dotool`.
- Something to copy text to the clipboard. Again, depending on the display server, you want `xclip`, `xsel` or `wl-copy`.
